## Introduction
The Absolut library has been developed at [AEE INTEC](https://www.aee-intec.at/en/) to investigate absorption thermodynamic cycles, with special attention to the absorption heat exchanger (AHE) as part of the austrian research project “[Absolut](https://www.aee-intec.at/project/absolut-absorptionstechnologien-als-loesungen-fuer-nachhaltige-fernwaerme-und-fernkaelte/)” (FFG-Nr.: 879433).
The library includes models for different absorption cycles at various levels of detail, most of which have been validated against literature values.

## Dependencies
[Buildings library v12.0](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/releases/tag/v12.0.0) is used for some heat exchanger models.

## Tool compatibility
The library has been developed using Dymola with partial testing performed in OpenModelica
