<p>The models in this package can be seen as an extension of the models within <a href=\"Absolut.FluidBased.Static.SingleEffect_intern\">SingleEffect_intern</a>. The models do include interfaces for the external fluids (<a href=\"Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort\">fluid ports</a>), i.e. the internal heat exchanger is modelled. </p>
<p>The main components are included diredtly within this package. Some adaptations are needed in order to build up special cycles, e.g. double effect heat pumps. The special additional models are stored within the respective packages. </p>
